"One of the first things we should do is check the phase of the oxygen in each of the tanks as this will determine our solution methods. While checking that, since we have the initial temperature and pressure of each section, we can determine the remaining state properties."

"We note that the oxygen is a compressed/subcooled liquid in both tanks at the intial state. We have two solution paths to follow then. We can either assume the tanks are completely rigid, or we can recall that liquids do not compress well and assume that the tanks must have some volume change. It is important to note here that even very small volume changes will drastically reduce or increase the pressure of the liquid oxygen. If we check the pressures found for the oxygen assuming constant volume, we will find that the change in pressure is extremely large, and thus the tanks in real life will have some volume change. Since both oxygen tanks will remain as compressed liquids, changes in pressure will have a very minimal effect on state properties (recall temperature was what we were concerned often with when using the steam tables). For solution #1, let us assume the pressure is approximately constant (as noted it is fairly inconsequential)."
 
 
"Since we know the pressure, we can find the equilibrium temperature by using the Conservation of Energy and solving for the final enthalpy. If our CV is around both sections inside the tank, then there is no heat transfer or work performed during the process."

"Now, we need to find the total entropy generated for the process. Note that due to differences in specific heat values and rounding errors, Matlab will likely give a slightly different answer than that found using EES. Either answer is acceptable though. We can use the 2nd Law to determine the entropy generated during the process. Again, if our CV is around both sections inside the tank, then we know that there is no heat transfer, and so the change in entropy from state 1 to 2 is equal to the entropy generated."

"For solution #2, let us now assume each section within the tank is completely rigid and has a constant volume. We know the final specific volume of each state for the two sections, but we do not have another property. We do know from the Conservation of energy, however, that U_2 must be equal to U_1 if our CV is around both sections inside the tank, as then there is no heat transfer or work performed during the process."
